#BDD Party!

This is an experimental web app where I am playing whith:

* At the rails side (server) 
	+ rspec
        + factory_girl
        + devise
        + Just a RESTful/JSON API

* At the browser side (client)
        + backbone.js
        + underscore.js
        + jQuery
        + Twitter Bootstrap

##Architecture
This app achieve a complete decoupling of controllers and views in Rails.
All the controllers do is to serve and consume JSON data. The front-end is build around this data.

##Future integrations

* Cucumber
* Jasmine
